Before we proceed, let me remind you that hacking someone's Facebook account without their consent is illegal and unethical. This tutorial is for educational purposes only and I am not responsible for any misuse or harm caused by it.
 
## Step 1: Check your Z-shadow account
 
After you have sent the phishing link to your target, you need to wait for them to click on it and enter their Facebook credentials. To check if they have done so, you need to log in to your Z-shadow account and go to the "My Victims" tab. There you will see a list of all the accounts that have been hacked by your phishing links.
 
If you see your target's Facebook account in the list, congratulations! You have successfully hacked their Facebook account. You will also see their email and password in plain text. You can copy them and use them to log in to their Facebook account from any device.
 
## Step 2: Log in to the hacked Facebook account
 
Once you have the email and password of the hacked Facebook account, you can log in to it from any browser or device. However, there are some things you need to be careful about:
 
- Do not change the password or any other settings of the hacked account. This will alert the owner and they will recover their account.
- Do not post anything or send any messages from the hacked account. This will also alert the owner and their friends.
- Do not use the hacked account for any illegal or malicious activities. This will get you in trouble with the law and Facebook.

The best thing to do with a hacked Facebook account is to use it for ethical hacking purposes. For example, you can use it to test the security of your own account or your friends' accounts. You can also use it to educate your target about phishing and how to avoid it in the future.
 
## Step 3: Delete the phishing link
 
After you have done what you wanted to do with the hacked Facebook account, you should delete the phishing link from your Z-shadow account. This will prevent anyone else from using it and hacking more accounts. To delete the phishing link, go to the "My Pages" tab and click on the "Delete" button next to the link.
 
This will also delete all the data associated with that link, including the email and password of the hacked account. So make sure you have copied them before deleting the link.
 
## Conclusion
 
In this tutorial, we learned how to hack any Facebook account using Z-shadow. We saw how to create a phishing page, send it to our target, access the hacked account, and delete the phishing link. We also learned some tips and precautions for ethical hacking using Z-shadow.
 
Z-shadow is a powerful tool for phishing and hacking social media accounts. However, it should be used responsibly and ethically. Hacking someone's Facebook account without their consent is illegal and unethical. It can cause harm to both you and your target. So please use Z-shadow only for educational purposes and with permission.
